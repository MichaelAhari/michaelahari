             <h4><i>A bit about me</i></h4>
             <p>My name is Michael, I'm 20 years old and I live in Edinburgh, UK.</p>
             <p>I'm in the 3rd year of my Computer Science degree at the University of Edinburgh, graduating in 2018.</p>
             <p>Outside of my studies I attend hackathons, working on cool projects, around the country. In 2016 I was involved in organising Hack The Burgh,
                 the second ever hackathon at my university, which was both fun and stressful at the same time!</p>
             <p>I like my sports too (I know that's weird for a tech person) - football (soccer-football, that is) and formula 1 are my favorite.</p>
             <p>And I also take photos from time to time. You can see some of my stuff here.</p>

             <h4><i>What I've been up to recently</i></h4>
             <p>In September 2016 I headed down to London for SIGNAL, a developer conference hosted by Twilio.</p>
                 <p>Topics ranged from multi player flappy bird using the new Sync API, to the theory of Cyborgs and Human API's, to building for social good with Twilio.org,
                 to doing cool stuff with Google's Vision API on their Cloud Platform. I met some awesome people and left with tons of new ideas, so overall a great day out!</p>
             <br>
             <h4><i>My Summer at JPMorgan Chase & Co.</i></h4>
             <p>I spent 10 weeks at JPM's Glasgow Technology Centre, in a team working on a new application to automate the rebalancing of client accounts. Primarily I worked individually on a new front end POC in Angular.</p>
             <p>For the last month or so, I also worked with the substantial backend codebase, writing interfaces to extract data loaded from the store and perform integrity validations on application start up.</p>
